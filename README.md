Can you please come up with a simple chess engine for analysis with CBMC? Store the engine in file ChessEngine.c , and let it include file ChessState.h in which the chessboard, pawn en-passe state and who moves next (White or Black) is defined. Given the chess game state, for the current player please select the best move, assuming that in each turn the current player selects the best move, while the other player moves non-deterministically. Please, store each move up to the search depth as 12 bits: 3 bits for each of (srcRow, srcCol, dstRow, dstCol). This way you can generate non-deterministic uint16_t modulo (8*8*8*8). In each turn, you validate the current (deterministic for the current player or non-deterministic for the opponent) move whether it is a legal move, and if so, whether it ends the game. Please, keep the nested loops to a minimum so that the program is easily transformable by CBMC to a Boolean Formula.

No, that doesn't look like a good idea. Can we instead of traversing all 8x8 source cells, traverse just up to 16 cells corresponding to pieces each player has? And are we really interested in what opponent's piece attacks a cell, or just the fact that a cell is attacked is enough in most cases? (Except the en-passe, which we can handle separately) So instead of storing just the board as 8x8 cells with a value denoting the figure in that cell, we may better also store separately the pieces of each player.
